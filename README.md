Welcome to the **Navbar Project**, where we will create a responsive navigation bar with two layouts. On small screens, the navbar features a logo and a toggle button that reveals or hides the links when clicked. There’s also a hover effect that changes text color and pushes the text slightly. On larger screens, the layout changes to display the logo and links in a horizontal line, along with social media icons using Font Awesome. The toggle functionality has already been prepared, and you’ll just need to add the JavaScript file to complete the project.
